# 🏥 Enhancing Breast Cancer Detection with Computational Intelligence Methods  

## 📌 Introduction  

Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases among women worldwide. Early detection significantly improves survival rates, yet traditional diagnostic methods such as mammography and biopsy can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these challenges, computational intelligence techniques offer promising solutions to enhance accuracy and efficiency in breast cancer detection.  

> 🔹 This project explores the application of **Neural Networks (NN), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to improve breast cancer diagnosis.  
> 🔹 By integrating **advanced machine learning algorithms**, we aim to develop a reliable and interpretable system for breast cancer classification.  

## ❗ Problem Statements  

Despite advancements in medical imaging and AI-based diagnostics, several challenges persist in breast cancer detection:  

🔸 **Diagnostic Errors** – Traditional methods may lead to misdiagnosis due to subjective interpretation of medical images.  
🔸 **Limited Dataset Size** – Small datasets can result in overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models.  
🔸 **Feature Selection Complexity** – Identifying the most relevant features from medical images and datasets remains a challenge.  
🔸 **Optimization Constraints** – Traditional backpropagation methods may not efficiently optimize neural networks for medical diagnosis.
